Introduction
============
This document will provide you with all the necessary information required to build your very own "Prototype Lab Flow" project.

What is the Protoype Lab Flow project?
Well in simple terms, this project is a realtime database that allows the user to add/remove items into the database by simply scanning QR Codes.

Why is is useful?
This project replaces the current item sign-out system used at the Humber Protoype Lab as well as the Humber Parts Crib. The current system requires a student to fill out a form and and lend their Humber ID Card in order to borrow items. This system is a slower process because students have to wait in queues just a fill out a form.  This project makes this system more efficient by allowing the adminstrator to simply scan QR Codes instead of waiting for the students to fill out thier forms.

If you are still on how the project will work or what will it do the systems diagram below should be helpful.
